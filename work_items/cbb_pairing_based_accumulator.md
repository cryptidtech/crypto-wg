# Crypto-systems Building Blocks: Pairing Based Accumulator

This is the fourth proposed work item in a series of work items under the
category of "crypto-systems building blocks".

This work item is to write a detailed technical white paper fully describing a
novel approach that creates compact pairing-based accumulators used for set
inclusion/exclusion proofs. This is a critical piece of building fully
decentralized crypto-systems as it represents a O(1) solution for revocation.

## Work Item Owners
- Dave Huseby (@dhuseby, dave@cryptid.tech, CryptID Technologies, Inc)
- Andreas Freitag (@coffeethecup, Independent Contributor)

## External Partners
- IETF, new WG for crypto-systems building blocks?

## Outcome
- Teach everybody the math for constructing pairing-based accumulators and
  their application in decentralized crypto-systems.

## Deliverables
- A technical white paper describing the technique and its related application.
- One or more reference implementations.
- The expected timeline is 1-3 months to completion.
- The audience is authentic data developer community that haven't--until now--
  solved the problem of scalable revocation.

### Relevant Related Standards
- [Privacy Preserving Revocation Proposal][0]

## Meetings
- Implementor updates are presented at the regular Applied Crypto WG meetings.

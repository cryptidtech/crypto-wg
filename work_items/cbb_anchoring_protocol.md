# Crypto-systems Building Blocks: Provenance Log Anchoring Protocol

This is the seventh proposed work item in a series of work items under the
category of "crypto-systems building blocks".

This work item is to propose an IETF standard for a protocol for "anchoring"
provenance logs in external trust services (e.g. public blockchains). This
seeks to define a universal approach to using pairing-based accumulators and
provenance log URNs to create an external, independently verifiable, proof-of-
existence, proof-of-completeness, and establish total global ordering of
cryptographic provenance logs. This is a critical part of building
decentralized crypto-systems that require the independent verification of
authentic data across multiple "trust domains".

## Work Item Owners
- Dave Huseby (@dhuseby, dave@cryptid.tech, CryptID Technologies, Inc)
- Hopefully somebody else :)

## External Partners
- IETF, new WG for crypto-systems building blocks?

## Outcome
- Establish a protocol for a privacy preserving anchoring of provenance logs.
- Establish the methods verifying proof-of-existence and proof-of-completeness
  of provenance logs from the externally anchored proof data.

## Deliverables
- An IETF formatted draft standard, ready for proposal.
- A white paper describing the cryptographic guarantees and applications of the
  external anchoring method.
- One or more reference implementations.
- The expected timeline is 1-3 months to completion.
- The audience is any developer that is working provenance logs and wishes to
  use URNs to reference them in related software.

## Meetings
- Implementor updates are presented at the regular Applied Crypto WG meetings.

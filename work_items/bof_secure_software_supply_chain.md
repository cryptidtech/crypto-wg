# BoF: Secure Software Supply Chain

This work item proposes to identify and contact other organziations and people
that are working towards zero-trust architecture solutions for securing the
software supply chain and then organize some form of community from that. I
think it is important that we realized that members of the Linux Kernel project
and the Open Secure Software Foundation and Google FIDO team, etc are all
working towards embuing the software supply chain tools (e.g. Git, continuous
delivery/deployment, etc) with cryptographic integrity both over the identities
of the contributors as well as the commits, builds, and build environments for
end-to-end integrity, reproducibility, and verifiability.

## Work Item Owners
- Dave Huseby (@dhuseby, dave@cryptid.tech, CryptID Technologies, Inc)
- You!

## Outcome
This is an extension of decentralized identity extended to all parts of the
software supply chain. The goal of this work item is to get everybody in the
same metaphorical room to learn of each other, discuss their approaches, and
attempt to coalesce around some set of principles and outcomes.

The "community" could take the form of a BoF session at a conference (e.g. IIW,
RWC), a mailing list, an agreement to all attend a meeting at the OpenSSF or
the DIF, or anything else. It is left undefined for now and will be revisited
after the existing people and orgs are identified and contacted.

## Deliverables
- A list of contacts and organizations working on zero-trust architecture
  software supply chain solutions.
- An invitation to be a part of whatever "community" event or infrastructure
  that is created to facilitate communication and coordination.
- The expected timeline is to form the list in a month and attempt to
  coordinate some kind of "community" before the end of the year.

## MeetingsA
- Owners will report progress at the regular Applied Crypto WG meetings.
